== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Jigoshop work with X theme? =

Jigoshop will in theory work with any theme, but of course, certain parts may need to be styled using CSS to make them match up. We've added default styling for Twenty Ten (the WordPress default theme) and we also provide a few bespoke themes optimised for Jigoshop.

If you need a theme built, or have a theme that needs styling, give us a shout and we may be able to assist (see http://jigowatt.co.uk/contact/).

= Can I have Jigoshop in my language =

Jigoshop comes with a .po file and is localisation ready. If you'd like to share your localisation with us please get in touch!

= Do you have an X payment gateway =

We will be introducing payment gateways incrementally, however, not all will be in the free version. If you want to request a payment gateway, or you have built one and you would like to share it with us, please get in touch.

= Do I have access to my order and product data? =

Orders and products are stored as custom post types in the WordPress database; you have full control of them and can import/export using WordPress' functions.

= Will tax settings work in my country? =

Jigoshop has a flexible tax rule system which allows you to define tax rates per country - it should allow you to do what you want.

= I need hosting! =

We offer optimised hosting packages starting from 10 GBP per month at http://jigowatt.co.uk

= I need support! =

We have a <a href="http://forum.jigoshop.com" title="Jigoshop support forum">community forum</a> for getting help from other users.

=== WooCommerce Print Invoices & Delivery Notes ===
Contributors: chabis, daveshine, deckerweb

Print order invoices & delivery notes for WooCommerce shop. You can add company/shop info as well as personal notes & policies to print pages.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can print out **simple invoices and delivery notes** for the orders **via the WooCommerce Shop Plugin**. You can edit the Company/Shop name, Company/Shop postal address and also add personal notes, conditions/policies (like a refund policy) and a footer imprint/branding.

The plugin adds a new side panel on the order page to allow shop administrators to print out delivery notes. This is useful for a lot of shops that sell goods which need delivery notes for shipping or with added refund policies etc. In some countries (e.g. in the European Union) such refund policies are required so this plugin could help to combine this with the order info for the customer.

= Features =
* The plugin comes with an attached template for the invoice and delivery note (printing) page - you could also copy this to your theme and customize it to your needs! The plugin will recognize the new place. (See under [FAQ here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/faq/))
* All setting fields on the plugin's settings pages are optional - you can leave them empty to not use them at all or only apply what you need.
* If the company/shop name field is left empty then the regular website/blog title is used (defined via regular WordPress options)
* If there are added "Customer Notes" (regular WooCommerce feature) for an order these will automatically displayed at the bottom of the delivery note.
* Modify the order numbering by prepend or append text to it.
* Included help tab system with new WordPress 3.3 standard! (Will also be extended if needed!)

* Tip for Genesis users: [*GenesisFinder* - Find then create. Your Genesis Framework Search Engine.](http://genesisfinder.com/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `woocommerce-delivery-notes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Look under the regular WooCommerce settings menu: "WooCommerce > Settings > Tab "Print" and adjust them to your needs
4. On single order pages you'll find a new meta box on the right side where it says "Order Print" you can open the invoice or delivery note for the actual order and print it out directly
5. Go and manage your orders - good luck with sales :)

**Please note:** You must run WordPress 3.3 or higher and WooCommerce 1.4 or higher in order tun this plugin. This is due to changes in WooCommerc v1.4+!

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/woocommerce-delivery-notes/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `woocommerce-delivery-notes-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use a custom template for the printing page? =
If you want to use your own template then all you need to do is copy the `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/templates/delivery-notes` folder and paste it inside your `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/woocommerce` folder (if not there just create it). The folder from the plugin comes with the default template and the basic CSS stylesheet file. You can modifiy this to fit your own needs.

*Note:* This works with both single themes and child themes (if you use some framework like Genesis). If your current active theme is a child theme put the custom folder there! (e.g. `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme-name/woocommerce`)

= Can I use a different custom template for invoices and delivery notes? =
Yes. Create in the `your-theme-name/woocommerce/delivery-notes` folder a file named `print-invoice.php` and another `print-delivery-note.php`. Or just create a file `print.php` to use the same template for invoices and delivery notes. Now write some nice code to make your templates look as you like. 

*Note:* The `print.php` isn't needed when you have a `print-invoice.php` and `print-delivery-note.php` file. However the template system falls back to the `print.php` file inside your themes folder and then inside the plugins folder when `print-invoice.php` and/or `print-delivery-note.php` weren't found.

= What Template Functions can I use? =
Various functions are available in the template, especially many Delivery Notes specific template functions. Open the `woocommerce-delivery-notes/woocommerce-delivery-notes-print.php` file to see all available functions.

*Please note:* This is only intended for developers who know what they do! Please be careful with adding any code/functions! The default template and functions should fit most use cases.

= What will actually get printed out? =
No worries, the print bar at the top will automatically be hidden on print!

The other sections get printed as styled via the packaged template (or your custom template if configured). For the shop/company name and all other notes sections: only these will get printed which are actually configured.

Beyond the styling of your template be aware of any special features of your used browser - I highly recommend to use the "Print Preview" feature of your browser which all current versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera support.

= Can you update the plugin with feature X or option Y? =
Mmh. Maybe.

The basic intention is to have the plugin at the same time as leightweight and useful as possible. So any feature request needs to be reviewed for that reasons.
