Print order invoices & delivery notes for WooCommerce shop. You can add company/shop info as well as personal notes & policies to print pages.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can print out **simple invoices and delivery notes** for the orders **via the WooCommerce Shop Plugin**. You can edit the Company/Shop name, Company/Shop postal address and also add personal notes, conditions/policies (like a refund policy) and a footer imprint/branding.

The plugin adds a new side panel on the order page to allow shop administrators to print out delivery notes. This is useful for a lot of shops that sell goods which need delivery notes for shipping or with added refund policies etc. In some countries (e.g. in the European Union) such refund policies are required so this plugin could help to combine this with the order info for the customer.

= Features =
* The plugin comes with an attached template for the invoice and delivery note (printing) page - you could also copy this to your theme and customize it to your needs! The plugin will recognize the new place. (See under [FAQ here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/faq/))
* All setting fields on the plugin's settings pages are optional - you can leave them empty to not use them at all or only apply what you need.
* If the company/shop name field is left empty then the regular website/blog title is used (defined via regular WordPress options)
* If there are added "Customer Notes" (regular WooCommerce feature) for an order these will automatically displayed at the bottom of the delivery note.
* Custom order numbering via the free [WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-sequential-order-numbers/) plugin.
* Included help tab system.
* Localized in English, German, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Slovakian, Finnish and Portuguese (BR). (thanks to all translators, submit your translation) - some of them only partial yet (we'd love to see you [complete them](http://translate.wpautobahn.com/projects/wordpress-plugins-deckerweb/woocommerce-delivery-notes) :).

Credit where credit is due: This plugin here is inspired and based on the work of Steve Clark, Trigvvy Gunderson and the awesome "Jigoshop Delivery Notes" plugin! See below how you can contribute to the further development of both:

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `woocommerce-delivery-notes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Look under the regular WooCommerce settings menu: "WooCommerce > Settings > Tab "Print" and adjust them to your needs
4. On single order pages you'll find a new meta box on the right side where it says "Order Print" you can open the invoice or delivery note for the actual order and print it out directly
5. Go and manage your orders - good luck with sales :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my company logo not displayed at the size I've uploaded it? =
Printed paper needs a higher pixel density for images than the screen. To make your printed logo look nice and crisp it will be resized via CSS to a fourth of the uploaded pixel size. This means: An image of 400p x 400px will be displayed as a 100px x 100px image but will be printed with the original amount of pixels. With the resizing, 288 pixels of the original image width correspond to about 1 printed inch.

= How can I change the address format of the recipient? =
WooCommerce includes address formats for many different countries. But maybe your country format isn't included. For such cases you can define your own format with a filter in your `functions.php` if you know your country code (ie `LI`).

`
function custom_localisation_address_formats($formats) {
	$formats['LI'] = "{company}\n{name}\n{address_1}\n{address_2}\n{postcode} {city}\n{country}";
	return $formats;
}
add_filter('woocommerce_localisation_address_formats', 'custom_localisation_address_formats');
`

= How can I use a custom CSS file for the printing page without copying and editing the template files? =
Copy the `style.css` (and no other file) from the `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/templates/print` folder and paste it inside your `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/woocommerce/print` folder (if not there just create it). You can modify CSS to fit your own needs. 

*Note:* There is automatically a class assigned to the html tag that helps you to target the template-type in your CSS.

= How can I use a custom template for the printing page? =
If you want to use your own template then all you need to do is copy the the files you want to edit from `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/templates/print` folder and paste them inside your `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/woocommerce/print` folder (if not there just create it). The folder from the plugin comes with the default templates and the basic CSS files. You can modifiy those to fit your own needs.

= What template functions can I use? =
All WordPress and all functions from other plugins and themes can be used. There are also many many specific template functions. Open the `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/woocommerce-delivery-notes.php` file to see all of them.

= How do I add more info or custom fields to the templates? =
Create a custom template (see questions above). Then edit the file to your needs. You can use all functions that are available in WordPress or any activated plugin or theme. 

Example: Show an order custom field that was added by another plugin (e.g. `'_my_custom_field'`)

`echo wcdn_get_order_custom_field('_my_custom_field');` 

= What will actually get printed out? =
The page will be printed as you see it in your browser when you enabled the preview. 

Beyond the styling of the template be aware of any special features of the used browser. They may not print websites properly or add a pagination or website url. Use a "Print Preview" feature of your browser which all current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera support.

= How can I translate the plugin with my own wording? =
For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/woocommerce-delivery-notes/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `woocommerce-delivery-notes-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes"). And finally contact one of the developers if you would like to add your translation to the standard distribution.
